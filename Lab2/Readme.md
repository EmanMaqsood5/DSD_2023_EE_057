## Combinational Circuits: Structural Modeling using Vivado
### Experiment overview:
  This experiment involves designing a simple combinational circuit using the Vivado Design Suite. The goal is to implement the circuit on an FPGA using structural modeling in SystemVerilog. The experiment covers creating a new project, writing SystemVerilog code, assigning I/O pins, synthesizing the design, generating a bitstream, and programming the FPGA.
### Procedure:
- To implement the combinational circuit in Vivado, first, create a new project. 

- After that, create a SystemVerilog file, write the logic equations as required in the experiment, and verify the schematic. 

- Assign I/O pins using either the I/O Planning tool or a constraints file. 

- Run synthesis and implementation, then generate the bitstream. 

- Connect the FPGA to the computer, open Hardware Manager, and program the device. 

- Finally, check the truth table, analyze the maximum combinational delay, and review device utilization in the synthesis report.
