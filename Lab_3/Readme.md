# *README – Combinational Circuit Simulation*  

## *Introduction*  
This project involved designing and simulating a combinational logic circuit using *SystemVerilog*. The main tasks were writing the circuit code, creating a testbench, running simulations in *QuestaSim*, and verifying the output.  

## *Tasks Performed*  

1. *Implemented a combinational circuit* and verified its truth table.  
2. *Debugged and corrected* the given full adder code.  
3. *Simulated both circuits* in QuestaSim and analyzed the waveforms.  

## *Procedure*  

### *1. Writing the Code*  
- Created the *RTL file* for the circuit using SystemVerilog.  
- Wrote a *testbench file* to test different input combinations.  
- Used the **timescale directive** to define simulation timing.  

### *2. Running the Simulation in QuestaSim*  
1. Created a *new project* in QuestaSim and added the RTL and testbench files.  
2. Compiled the code and fixed any *errors*.  
3. Simulated the testbench and checked the *waveform outputs* to verify the circuit’s behavior.  

### *3. Debugging the Full Adder Code*  
- Identified and fixed errors in the given full adder SystemVerilog code.  
- Re-ran the simulation to ensure the circuit worked correctly.  

## *Conclusion*  
This lab helped me understand how to *design, test, and simulate* combinational circuits using SystemVerilog and QuestaSim. Debugging errors and analyzing waveforms gave me a better understanding of digital circuit simulation.
